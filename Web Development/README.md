## **Sanguosha Card Game**
***DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT CREATE THE ORIGINAL REPO FOR THE GAME, THIS REPOSITORY WAS FORKED FOR ADDING NEW EXPANSIONS.***\
***FULL CREDIT GOES TO THE ORIGINAL CREATOR AT: https://github.com/kevinychen/sanguosha***


After finding the original version, my friend Raymond ([@Stinggyray](https://github.com/Stinggyray)) and I wanted to add our own mechanics/expansions missing in the original instance, which is exactly what we did!\
My version of the game can be found at the following link: https://github.com/truebqccq/sanguosha


## **Computing Team Website**

As the captain of my high school competitive programming team, it was natural that we created our own website for it. So alongside Raymond ([@Stinggyray](https://github.com/Stinggyray), the other captain), we coded the website for our club. Since he had more experience with web development, he created most of the infrastructure, while I helped make the resource pages for USACO and ACSL topics, including data structures, graph theory, FSAs... 

After our graduation, we have passed the torch to our newer captains, and I am proud to say that the club is still running, with even more pages on the website, at https://nvcomputing.com/!
