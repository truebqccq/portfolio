# Google Calendar Manager
To help me efficiently add all my classes into Google Calendar, I did what any programmer would do: ~~manually add all my classes~~ spend an entire day learning how to use the Google Calendar API and writing a parser that simplifies the input process. 

The next step of this manager is to directly incorporate the school's courses website and get the data from there. Well maybe, since this was before I found out I can download the csv files from the schedule planners directly...
