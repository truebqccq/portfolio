# Project Euler
A set of problems that combines my love for math and computer science, challenging my knowledge and skills in both fields. I would spend many hours at a time attempting the problems, stopping only when I solve them. Or that's what I myself, since usually I have to sleep or attend classes before I can finish. But I enjoyed every minute I spend on these problems, researching new topics, learning new concepts, and coding the solutions.

## Progress
As to abide by the rules of Project Euler, I will not be posting any code/solutions. If interested, please feel free to email [me](mailto:kennez2@uci.edu)!
