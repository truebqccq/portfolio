# Minecraft Datapacks
As a long time player of Minecraft, I have created quite a few minigames to play with my friends. This includes two original maps and many datapacks that can be added to different worlds.

A select few has been included in the portfolio:
- Flower Power: breaking flowers will give the player random items, to either complete a collection goal or build gear for pvp
- Lucky Block: every player is given a set amount of "lucky blocks," which when broken, will give the player random chest loots. Afterwards players will brawl in a battlefield.
- Rainbow Six: using an existing map, I partially recreated Rainbow Six Siege in Minecraft, with a subset of characters and functional rounds.
- Valorant: my attempt at recreating Valorant in Minecraft. Currently incomplete, with most characters and the shop unfinished.
