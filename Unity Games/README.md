# Unity Games
In the summer program National High School Game Academy, I learned about all aspects of game development, from story to level design, art to programming. 

The included file is the hackathon game, for which we were provided basic assets, and allotted four hours to create. The game I created is a simple party game, where your goal is to survive as long as possible by standing on the correct colored squares, while collecting orbs around the map.
